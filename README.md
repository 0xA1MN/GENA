## What We Are Working On
We’re tackling the problem of surgical intervention to know whether a brain tumor will have a specific genetic sequence 
(MGMT promoter methylation) or not

## Procedures
1. Develop a system which help in predicting the genetics of the cancer through imaging
2. The model will be covered by an interface that will do the image processing required before deciding
3. A developer wants to access our ML model API, he can submit a request via the website and access the API to use it

## CURRENT SOLUTIONS
Currently, genetic analysis of cancer requires surgery to extract a tissue sample. 
There is some models predicting this but it has a low accuracy so, we’re going to improve it
